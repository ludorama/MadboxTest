# MadboxTest

- Project developed using Unity 2019.1.5f1
- Time spent: 5h (took a couple minutes to make a repo, didn't noticed it when I first read the description, sorry!)

Parts that I found difficult:
- There weren't anything difficult on itself, but the lack of time to properly develop a spline-based movement system (instead of use the one I developed previously) made it difficult to make things feel right (more on this in the next section)
- On the other hand, it took me a couple minutes to get used with Unity dev flow again (developed a couple micro games through the week tho). That led me to spend precious minutes on things that could have took seconds otherwise. Eg. sine-based rotation, which is not implemented like in UE4 and I simply forgot how it's done :( I guess I need a couple more days to get everything back to normal (like 10 years on Unity)

What I could have done better:
- As I had to improvise with the movement system (point-by-point instead of spline-based), everything felt blocky and jumpy, especially the camera.
- Camera: I even tried damping its movement a bit, but I would need a couple more minutes to get it right. With a spline system the camera could be indepentent of character transform, so always smooth and nice.
- Unfortunately, there were no time for VFX or fancy shaders. I even tried building one (to fix some visuals features like infinite ground depth), but I didn't had the time to.
- The same goes with character animation, which unfortunately was not possible to implement (got the vars ready for that tho).
- Ideally there would be a ragdoll on the character to properly react to hits, but right now he simply vanishes for a second. Better than nothing, I guess.
- No scoring, which is a shame. But you can win and receive a nice Log entry tho :), and an automatic restart
- As I said before I forgot how to make a sine animation, so the wreckage trap swing weirdly. Hope nobody will have their eyes exploding while looking at it :(

I guess that's everything. It was an awesome test, a very good reason to go back at full on Unity development again, gamejam-like (my home). Thanks Mr. Thomas for your time and appreciation, and hopefully it matches your expectations. Best regards,
