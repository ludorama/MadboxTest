# MadboxTest

- Project developed using Unity 2019.1.5f1
- Time spent: 5h (took a couple minutes to make a repo, didn't noticed it when I first read the description, sorry!)

Parts that I found difficult:
- There weren't anything difficult on itself, but the lack of time to properly develop a spline-based movement system (instead of use the one I developed previously) made it difficult to make things feel right (more on this in the next section)
- On the other hand, it took me a couple minutes to get used with Unity dev flow again (developed a couple micro games through the week tho). That led me to spend precious minutes on things that could have took seconds otherwise. Eg. sine-based rotation, which is not implemented like in UE4 and I simply forgot how it's done :( I guess I need a couple more days to get everything back to normal (like 10 years on Unity)

What I could have done better:
- As I had to improvise with the movement system (point-by-point instead of spline-based), everything felt blocky and jumpy, especially the camera.
- Camera: I even tried damping its movement a bit, but I would need a couple more minutes to get it right. With a spline system the camera could be indepentent of character transform, so always smooth and nice.
- Unfortunately, there were no time for VFX or fancy shaders. I even tried building one (to fix some visuals features like infinite ground depth), but I didn't had the time to.
- The same goes with character animation, which unfortunately was not possible to implement (got the vars ready for that tho).
- Ideally there would be a ragdoll on the character to properly react to hits, but right now he simply vanishes for a second. Better than nothing, I guess.
- No scoring, which is a shame. But you can win and receive a nice Log entry tho :), and an automatic restart
- As I said before I forgot how to make a sine animation, so the wreckage trap swing weirdly. Hope nobody will have their eyes exploding while looking at it :(

What would I do a setp further:
- 3 more AI players (I actually had it, but I didn't had the time to make each trackpoint delivering their offset points aligned with the track - again, shame not having a spline system!)
- Track splitting and shortcuts, so users might need to choose between moving forward or trying a different path
- Moving platforms, which is pretty much default but I lacked the time to
- Slopes and jumps - again, lack of time to properly test movement behaviors
- Items perhaps, Mariokart-like? Not sure about it, but could work

What do I think
- It was an awesome test, a very good reason to go back at full on Unity development again, gamejam-like (where I feel home).
- I thought it would be much worse than it actually went, so it felt sort of reassuring for me that all those Unity years are not gone from my veins. I'm working mostly with UE4/C++ for the last 3 years or so, with Unity sparsely on my personal projects. Thought this could ruin this test for me.
- If that's how the job goes, BRING IT ON! :)


I guess that's everything. Thanks Mr. Thomas for your time and appreciation, and hopefully it matches your expectations. Best regards,
